        Please provide a searchable summary of the issue in the title above ‚¨ÜÔ∏è.
        ‚ö†Ô∏è SUPER-busy repo, please help the volunteer maintainers.
        The less time we spend here, the more time we spend building AutoGPT.
        
        Please help us help you:
        - Does it work on `stable` branch (https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/tree/stable)?
        - Does it work on current `master` (https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/tree/master)?
        - Search for existing issues, "add comment" is tidier than "new issue" and newer issues will not be reviewed earlier, 
          this is dependent on the current priorities set by our wonderful team
        - Ask on our Discord (https://discord.gg/autogpt)
        - Provide relevant info:
          - Provide commit-hash (`git rev-parse HEAD` gets it)
          - If it's a pip/packages issue, provide pip version, python version
          - If it's a crash, provide traceback.
