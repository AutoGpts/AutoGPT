<!-- ðŸ“¢ Announcement
We've recently noticed an increase in pull requests focusing on combining multiple changes. While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:

Focus on a single, specific change.
Do not include any unrelated or "extra" modifications.
Provide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.
Ensure diffs are limited to the intended lines â€” no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).
For guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg

By following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->

### Background
<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->

### Changes
<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or "extra" changes. -->

### Documentation
<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->

### Test Plan

### PR Quality Checklist
- [ ] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.
- [ ] I have thouroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.
- [ ] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.
- [ ] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.
- [ ] I have not snuck in any "extra" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as seperate Pull Reqests, they are the easiest to merge! -->
- [ ] This is not a duplicate PR <!-- If it's a defect many people submit the same thing -->

<!-- Explain how you tested this functionality. Include the steps to reproduce and any relevant test cases. -->

### Change Focus

<!-- As there are many PRs, only quality PRs will be merged. This means that the PRs should be focused: 
 
- if it's linting it should only include linting, such as changed whitespace, alignment, double empty lines etc
- if it's refactoring, refactor one thing
- if it's a new feature, make it so it doesn't complicate the installation procedure, especially for Windows users
- if it does complicate it, make it entirely optional. Make sure the dummy .env is not littered with variables 99% of beginner users won't need.

### Change Safety

<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->

<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guide lines. -->
