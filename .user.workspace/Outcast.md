1. `take_screenshot(x, y, w, h)`: Captures a screenshot of the given region of the screen and returns it as an image object.

2. `activate_chat_panel()`: Activates the chat panel by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+A` and focuses on the response window.

3. `capture_screenshot(width)`: Captures a series of three screenshots to ensure the entire chat panel is captured, starting with the current view and scrolling up twice with the `PgUp` key.

4. `_extracted_from_capture_screenshot_1(screenshots)`: Helper function for `capture_screenshot()` that captures the second screenshot after scrolling up once with the `PgUp` key.

5. `stitch_screenshots(screenshot1, screenshot2, screenshot3)`: Stitches together the three screenshots captured by `capture_screenshot()` into a single image.

6. `press_key_1(delay)`: Scrolls down twice with the `PgDn` key to restore the previous chat panel view.

7. `extract_text_from_image(image)`: Extracts text from an image using Tesseract OCR and returns the results as a dictionary.

8. `find_clear_conversation_text(data)`: Finds the "Clear conversation" text in the chat panel and returns it as a string.

9. `find_timestamp(data, timestamp_regex)`: Finds the most recent timestamp in the chat panel that matches the given regular expression and returns it as a string.

10. `capture_response_text()`: Captures the response window by taking a screenshot of the region defined by `response_window` and returns the text contained in the image as a string using Tesseract OCR.

11. `write_to_file(text)`: Writes the given text to a file named `codeium_conversation.md`.

12. `main()`: The main function that orchestrates the entire script. It activates the chat panel, captures the necessary screenshots, stitches them together, extracts text from the images, finds the timestamp and "Clear conversation" text, captures the response window, combines the extracted text into a Markdown-formatted string, and writes the string to a file.
