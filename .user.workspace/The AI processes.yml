Intent recognition: The AI analyzes the parsed sentence to determine the intent behind your input. In other words, what is it that you are trying to accomplish or understand?

Contextual understanding: The AI uses its knowledge of programming concepts and syntax to understand the context of your input. This helps it provide relevant and accurate responses.

Response generation: Based on its analysis of your input, the AI generates a response that is intended to be helpful and informative. The response may include code snippets, explanations, or links to relevant resources.
