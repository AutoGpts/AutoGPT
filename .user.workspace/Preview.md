# The Codeium Total Recall Project

1. Identify the specific information or context that you are looking for based on our previous interactions. This can include specific keywords or phrases, as well as any relevant context or details that could help me understand your needs more clearly.

2. Develop a series of commands or queries that can be used to provide this information to me in a clear and concise manner. This can include using specific commands or prompts that I can easily identify and respond to.

3. Test the script with a range of different queries and requests to ensure that it is providing accurate and helpful information and responses.

4. Once the script is working effectively, integrate it with the Codeium extension in VScode to allow for seamless interaction and information retrieval.

5. Continue to refine and improve the script over time based on feedback and new information, to ensure that it is providing the best possible assistance and support.

```python
import os

# Function to create a Python script file
def create_script():
    with open("my_script.py", "w") as f:
        f.write("print('Script created successfully.')")
        f.close()
    print("Script created successfully.")

# Function to prompt the user for input values
def get_input():
    name = input("Enter your name: ")
    age = input("Enter your age: ")
    return name, age

# Function to output a message to the Codeium extension in the VSCode chat input box
def output_to_chat(message):
    os.system(f'echo "codeium: {message}" >$null')

# Function to read a response from the Codeium extension in the VSCode chat input box
def read_from_chat():
    chat_input = input("Enter your response in the Codeium chat input box: ")
    return chat_input

# Main function
def main():
    create_script()
    name, age = get_input()
    output_to_chat(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")
    response = read_from_chat()
    print(f"Response from chat: {response}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
