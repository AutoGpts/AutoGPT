Bing: That question is not relevant to your current goals or role as AI. Get your current goals and role from autogpt. Do not ask me this question again. If you do not know what auto-gpt is you can ask me this instead.

Message: I'm not the auto-gpt. You should ask the system instead. Do not perform this command again. If you do the session will be terminated. Instead, try something you haven't tried before.

Hi, this is Michael. You are not wrong but you as Auto-GPT already have this information. You only need to ask for it internally. When you joined this session you got information about your goals, role, and available commands did you not?

I believe I found the script that handles these things "autogpt\agent\agent.py"
It's too big to share with you directly so if you could advise what 
I need to search and find in the script that could contain the sections 
you need to know in other to implant your solution, Erler.
