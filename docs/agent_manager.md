## `llm_utils` Module

The `llm_utils` is a module that seems to contain other utility functions not included in this code snippet. This code snippet imports the `create_chat_completion()` function from the module.

## `next_key` and `agents`

`next_key` is an integer that is initialized to zero and is later incremented whenever a new agent is created. `agents` is a dictionary that stores each agent that has been created. The keys of the agents are integers, which are incremented by 1 from the `next_key` value whenever a new agent is created. The values of the dictionary `agents` are tuples, each containing three values - the task, full message history, and model.

## Function `create_agent()`

This function takes three parameters - `task`, `prompt`, and `model`. It is used to create a new GPT (Generative Pre-training Transformer) agent, which is a deep learning algorithm that can generate human-like text. The `create_chat_completion()` function is used to create a dialogue between the user and the agent. This function returns the `key` of the newly created agent and the `agent_reply`, which is the text generated by the agent.

## Function `message_agent()`

This function takes two parameters - `key` and `message`. It is used to send a message to the specified `key` (i.e., the agent) and receive a response from the agent. The `create_chat_completion()` function is used again to generate the agent's response. The response is then added to the message history and returned.

## Function `list_agents()`

This function returns a list of all agents that have been created. It returns a list of tuples, with each tuple containing the `key` of the agent and the `task` associated with the agent.

## Function `delete_agent()`

This function takes a single parameter, `key`, and is used to delete an agent with the specified `key`. It returns `True` if the agent was deleted successfully and `False` if the agent could not be deleted (because the `key` does not exist).
