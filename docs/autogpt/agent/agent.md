This is the implementation of the `Agent` class for interacting with Auto-GPT. The `Agent` class serves as an interface for users to interact with the auto-generating text model. It has a `start_interaction_loop()` method that implements the interaction loop to receive user input and generate responses using the GPT model.

The `Agent` class has the following attributes:

- `ai_name`: the name of the agent.
- `memory`: the memory object to use.
- `full_message_history`: the full message history.
- `next_action_count`: the number of actions to execute.
- `command_registry`: the registry of available commands.
- `config`: the configuration object to use.
- `system_prompt`: the system prompt that defines everything the AI needs to know to achieve its task successfully.
- `triggering_prompt`: the last sentence the AI will see before answering.

The `start_interaction_loop()` method implements an interaction loop where the agent generates responses to user input. It takes no arguments and returns nothing. While the loop is running, it receives user input, generates a response from the GPT model, executes any commands specified in the response, and updates the message history.

The `Agent` class depends on several other modules in the auto-generating text library, such as `autogpt.app`, `autogpt.config`, `autogpt.chat`, `autogpt.json_utils`, `autogpt.logs`, `autogpt.speech`, `autogpt.spinner`, and `autogpt.utils`.
