# `MemoryProviderSingleton` class description:

This code defines a base class for memory providers. The class `MemoryProviderSingleton` is an abstract base class that cannot be instantiated. It defines a set of abstract methods that need to be implemented by any concrete subclass that inherits from it. 

This class inherits from the `AbstractSingleton` class from the `autogpt.config` module. The `AbstractSingleton` provides a framework for defining Singleton classes, i.e., classes that should have only one instance throughout the entire lifecycle of an application.

The `get_ada_embedding` function defined in this module takes in a string text, preprocesses it by replacing newline characters with spaces, and then uses the OpenAI API to obtain embeddings for this text. The API used and the model deployed depends on the configuration data present in the `cfg` object.

## Methods
This class defines the following abstract methods that have to be implemented by any concrete subclass:
- `add(self, data)` : Add data to the memory
- `get(self, data)` : Retrieve data from the memory
- `clear(self)` : Clear the memory of all data
- `get_relevant(self, data, num_relevant=5)` : Get a given number of relevant data based on input query data
- `get_stats(self)` : Get statistics of the memory provider's memory.
