# Class `PineconeMemory`

This is a class that provides a memory provider for the Auto-GPT chatbot. It is called `PineconeMemory` and it extends the `MemoryProviderSingleton` class from the `autogpt.memory.base` module. It is responsible for handling the storage of data, retrieval of data, and monitoring of the memory statistics.

## Methods

### `__init__(self, cfg)`

This is the constructor method that initializes the class instance. It takes in a `cfg` argument, which is an object holding the configuration details of the chatbot.

The method sets up the Pinecone environment by initializing the API key and environment. It then sets the dimension, metric, pod type and table name for the Pinecone. If the table does not exist, it creates it.

### `add(self, data)`

This method adds a new data vector to the memory. It takes in a `data` argument, which is the chat input data. It creates an embedding vector using `create_embedding_with_ada` function from the `autogpt.llm_utils` module.

The method then adds the embedding vector to the Pinecone index along with the raw text. It returns a string value indicating that the data has been inserted into memory.

### `get(self, data)`

This method retrieves data from the memory that matches the input data. It takes in a `data` argument, which is the chat input data. It then calls the `get_relevant` method and returns the first item in the result list.

### `clear(self)`

This method clears all the data stored in the Pinecone index. It calls the `delete` function from the Pinecone module, deleting all the data in the index.

### `get_relevant(self, data, num_relevant=5)`

This method retrieves the relevant data from the memory that matches the input data. It takes in a `data` argument, which is the chat input data, and a `num_relevant` argument, which specifies the number of relevant data to return (defaults to 5).

It creates an embedding vector from the input data using the `create_embedding_with_ada` function from the `autogpt.llm_utils` module. It then queries the Pinecone index with the embedding vector and returns the relevant metadata.

### `get_stats(self)`

This method returns the memory statistics for the Pinecone index using the `describe_index_stats` function from the Pinecone module. It returns a dictionary of statistics such as the number of embeddings in the index, the number of unique embeddings, and the index size.
