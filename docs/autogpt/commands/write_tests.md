## Module `test_case_generator`

This module contains a function named `write_tests` that generates test cases for a given code. The function takes in two arguments: `code` and `focus`, and returns a string value with test cases generated for the submitted code.

### Function `write_tests`

```python
def write_tests(code: str, focus: list[str]) -> str:
```

**Input**
- `code` (str): A string containing the code for which the test cases need to be generated.
- `focus` (list[str]): A list of suggestions around what needs to be improved.

**Output**
- Return: A string with test cases generated for the submitted `code`.

**Example**

```python
import test_case_generator

code = "def calculate_square(x: int) -> int:\n   return x ** 2"

focus = ["improve function efficiency", "refactor function"]
result = test_case_generator.write_tests(code, focus)
print(result)
```

Output:
```
The generated test cases for the submitted code will be printed here.
