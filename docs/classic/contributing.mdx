If you are reading this, you are probably looking for the full **[contribution guide](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/wiki/Contributing)**, which is part of our [wiki](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/wiki).

Also check out our [Roadmap](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/discussions/6971) for information about our priorities and associated tasks.

## Contributing to the AutoGPT Platform Folder

All contributions to [the autogpt_platform folder](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/blob/master/autogpt_platform) will be under our [Contribution License Agreement](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/blob/master/autogpt_platform/Contributor%20License%20Agreement%20(CLA).md). By making a pull request contributing to this folder, you agree to the terms of our CLA for your contribution. All contributions to other folders will be under the MIT license.

## In short

1.  Avoid duplicate work, issues, PRs etc.
2.  We encourage you to collaborate with fellow community members on some of our bigger [todo's](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/discussions/6971)!
3.  We highly recommend to post your idea and discuss it in the [dev channel](https://discord.com/channels/1092243196446249134/1095817829405704305).
4.  Create a draft PR when starting work on bigger changes.
5.  Adhere to the [Code Guidelines](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/wiki/Contributing#code-guidelines)
6.  Clearly explain your changes when submitting a PR.
7.  Don't submit broken code: test/validate your changes.
8.  Avoid making unnecessary changes, especially if they're purely based on your personal preferences. Doing so is the maintainers' job. ;-)
9.  Please also consider contributing something other than code; see the [contribution guide](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/wiki/Contributing) for options.

If you wish to involve with the project (beyond just contributing PRs), please read the wiki page about [Catalyzing](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/wiki/Catalyzing).

In fact, why not just look through the whole wiki (it's only a few pages) and hop on our Discord. See you there! :-)
