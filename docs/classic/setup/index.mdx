## Setting up AutoGPT

### Getting AutoGPT

Since we don't ship AutoGPT as a desktop application, you'll need to download the
[project] from GitHub and give it a place on your computer.

<Frame>
    <img src="/classic/setup/get-repo-dialog.png"/>
</Frame>
- To get the latest bleeding edge version, use `master`.
- If you're looking for more stability, check out the latest AutoGPT [release][releases].

</CardGroup>

<Info>
**NOTE**

These instructions don't apply if you're looking to run AutoGPT as a docker image.
Instead, check out the [Docker setup](./docker.md) guide.

</Info>
### Completing the Setup

Once you have cloned or downloaded the project, you can find the AutoGPT Agent in the
`original_autogpt/` folder.
Inside this folder you can configure the AutoGPT application with an `.env` file and (optionally) a JSON configuration file:

- `.env` for environment variables, which are mostly used for sensitive data like API keys
- a JSON configuration file to customize certain features of AutoGPT's [Components](/classic/forge/components/introduction)

See the [Configuration](../configuration/options.md) reference for a list of available environment variables.

1. Find the file named `.env.template`. This file may
    be hidden by default in some operating systems due to the dot prefix. To reveal
    hidden files, follow the instructions for your specific operating system:
    [Windows][show hidden files/Windows] and [macOS][show hidden files/macOS].
2. Create a copy of `.env.template` and call it `.env`;
    if you're already in a command prompt/terminal window:
    ```shell
    cp .env.template .env
    ```
3. Open the `.env` file in a text editor.
4. Set API keys for the LLM providers that you want to use: see [below](#setting-up-llm-providers).
5. Enter any other API keys or tokens for services you would like to use.

<Info>
**NOTE**

To activate and adjust a setting, remove the `# ` prefix.
</Info>

6. Save and close the `.env` file.
7. _Optional: run `poetry install` to install all required dependencies._ The
    application also checks for and installs any required dependencies when it starts.
8. _Optional: configure the JSON file (e.g. `config.json`) with your desired settings._
    The application will use default settings if you don't provide a JSON configuration file.
    Learn how to [set up the JSON configuration file](/classic/forge/components/components#json-configuration)

You should now be able to explore the CLI (`./autogpt.sh --help`) and run the application.

See the [user guide](../usage.md) for further instructions.

## Setting up LLM providers

You can use AutoGPT with any of the following LLM providers.
Each of them comes with its own setup instructions.

AutoGPT was originally built on top of OpenAI's GPT-4, but now you can get
similar and interesting results using other models/providers too.
If you don't know which to choose, you can safely go with OpenAI*.

<small>* subject to change</small>

### OpenAI

<Info>
    **Attention**

     To use AutoGPT with GPT-4 (recommended), you need to set up a paid OpenAI account
    with some money in it. Please refer to OpenAI for further instructions ([link][openai/help-gpt-4-access]).
    Free accounts are [limited][openai/api-limits] to GPT-3.5 with only 3 requests per minute.
</Info>

1. Make sure you have a paid account with some credits set up: [Settings > Organization > Billing][openai/billing]
1. Get your OpenAI API key from: [API keys][openai/api-keys]
2. Open `.env`
3. Find the line that says `OPENAI_API_KEY=`
4. Insert your OpenAI API Key directly after = without quotes or spaces:
    ```ini
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    ```

<Info>
**Using a GPT Azure-instance**

If you want to use GPT on an Azure instance, set `USE_AZURE` to `True` and
make an Azure configuration file.

Rename `azure.yaml.template` to `azure.yaml` and provide the relevant
`azure_api_base`, `azure_api_version` and deployment IDs for the models that you
want to use.

E.g. if you want to use `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-4-turbo`:

```yaml
# Please specify all of these values as double-quoted strings
# Replace string in angled brackets (<>) to your own deployment Name
azure_model_map:
    gpt-3.5-turbo: "<gpt-35-turbo-deployment-id>"
    gpt-4-turbo: "<gpt-4-turbo-deployment-id>"
    ...
```

Details can be found in the [openai/python-sdk/azure], and in the [Azure OpenAI docs] for the embedding model.
If you're on Windows you may need to install an [MSVC library](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170).

### Llamafile

With llamafile you can run models locally, which means no need to set up billing,
and guaranteed data privacy.

For more information and in-depth documentation, check out the [llamafile documentation].

<Warning>
    **Warning**

    At the moment, llamafile only serves one model at a time. This means you can not
    set `SMART_LLM` and `FAST_LLM` to two different llamafile models.

</Warning>
<Warning>
    **Warning**

    Due to the issues linked below, llamafiles don't work on WSL. To use a llamafile
    with AutoGPT in WSL, you will have to run the llamafile in Windows (outside WSL).
    <Accordion title="Instructions">
    1. Get the `llamafile/serve.py` script through one of these two ways:
        1. Clone the AutoGPT repo somewhere in your Windows environment,
           with the script located at `classic/original_autogpt/scripts/llamafile/serve.py`
        2. Download just the [serve.py] script somewhere in your Windows environment
    2. Make sure you have `click` installed: `pip install click`
    3. Run `ip route | grep default | awk '{print $3}'` *inside WSL* to get the address
       of the WSL host machine
    4. Run `python3 serve.py --host {WSL_HOST_ADDR}`, where `{WSL_HOST_ADDR}`
       is the address you found at step 3.
       If port 8080 is taken, also specify a different port using `--port {PORT}`.
    5. In WSL, set `LLAMAFILE_API_BASE=http://{WSL_HOST_ADDR}:8080/v1` in your `.env`.
    6. Follow the rest of the regular instructions below.

    * [Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile#100](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/issues/100)
</Warning>
<Info>
    **Note**

    These instructions will download and use `mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q5_K_M.llamafile`.
    `mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2` is currently the only tested and supported model.
    If you want to try other models, you'll have to add them to `LlamafileModelName` in
    [`llamafile.py`][classic/forge/llamafile.py].
    For optimal results, you may also have to add some logic to adapt the message format,
    like `LlamafileProvider._adapt_chat_messages_for_mistral_instruct(..)` does.
</Info>

1. Run the llamafile serve script:
   ```shell
   python3 ./scripts/llamafile/serve.py
   ```
   The first time this is run, it will download a file containing the model + runtime,
   which may take a while and a few gigabytes of disk space.

   To force GPU acceleration, add `--use-gpu` to the command.

3. In `.env`, set `SMART_LLM`/`FAST_LLM` or both to `mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2`

4. If the server is running on different address than `http://localhost:8080/v1`,
   set `LLAMAFILE_API_BASE` in `.env` to the right base URL
