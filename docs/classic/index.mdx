**Location:** `classic/original_autogpt/` in the GitHub repo

The concept was (and still is) fairly simple: let an LLM decide what to do over and over, while feeding the results of its actions back into the prompt. This allows the program to iteratively and incrementally work towards its objective.

The fact that this program is able to execute actions on behalf of its user makes it an **agent**. In the case of AutoGPT, the user still has to authorize every action, but as the project progresses we'll be able to give the agent more autonomy and only require consent for select actions.

AutoGPT is a **generalist agent**, meaning it is not designed with a specific task in mind. Instead, it is designed to be able to execute a wide range of tasks across many disciplines, as long as it can be done on a computer.

## AutoGPT Classic Documentation

Welcome to the AutoGPT Classic Documentation.

The AutoGPT project consists of four main components:

* The [Agent](#agent) – also known as just "AutoGPT"
* The [Benchmark](#benchmark) – AKA `agbenchmark`
* The [Forge](#forge)
* The [Frontend](#frontend)

To tie these together, we also have a [CLI](#cli) at the root of the project.

The heart of AutoGPT, and the project that kicked it all off: a semi-autonomous agent powered by LLMs to execute any task for you*.

We continue to develop this project with the goal of providing access to AI assistance to the masses, and building the future transparently and together.

* <Icon icon="lightbulb" iconType="solid" /> **Explore** \- See what AI can do and be inspired by a glimpse of the future.

* <Icon icon="rocket" iconType="solid" /> **Build with us** \- We welcome any input, whether it's code or ideas for new features or improvements! Join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/autogpt) and find out how you can join in on the action.

## <Icon icon="bullseye" iconType="solid" size="28"/> Benchmark

**[<Icon icon="file" iconType="solid" /> Readme](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/blob/master/classic/benchmark/README.md)**

Measure your agent's performance! The `agbenchmark` can be used with any agent that supports the agent protocol, and the integration with the project's [CLI](#cli) makes it even easier to use with AutoGPT and forge-based agents. The benchmark offers a stringent testing environment. Our framework allows for autonomous, objective performance evaluations, ensuring your agents are primed for real-world action.

* <Icon icon="box" iconType="solid" /> [**`agbenchmark`**](https://pypi.org/project/agbenchmark/) on Pypi

* <Icon icon="plug" iconType="solid" /> **Agent Protocol Standardization** \- AutoGPT uses the agent protocol from the AI Engineer Foundation to ensure compatibility with many agents, both from within and outside the project.

## <Icon icon="wrench" iconType="solid" size="28"/> CLI

The project CLI makes it easy to use all of the components in the repo, separately or together. To install its dependencies, simply run `./run setup`, and you're ready to go!

```bash
$ ./run
Usage: cli.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  agent      Commands to create, start and stop agents
  benchmark  Commands to start the benchmark and list tests and categories
  setup      Installs dependencies needed for your system.
```
Common commands:

* `./run agent start autogpt` – [runs](/classic/usage#serve-agent-protocol-mode-with-ui) the AutoGPT agent
* `./run agent create <name>` – creates a new Forge-based agent project at `agents/<name>`
* `./run benchmark start <agent>` – benchmarks the specified agent
