title: Component Agents

<Note>
**Important**

[Legacy plugins](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugins) no longer work with AutoGPT. They have been replaced by components, although we're still working on a new system to load plug-in components.
</Note>

This guide explains the component-based architecture of AutoGPT agents. It's a new way of building agents that is more flexible and easier to extend. Components replace some agent's logic and plugins with a more modular and composable system.

Agent is composed of _components_, and each _component_ implements a range of _protocols_ (interfaces), each one providing a specific functionality, e.g. additional commands or messages. Each _protocol_ is handled in a specific order, defined by the agent. This allows for a clear separation of concerns and a more modular design.

This system is simple, flexible, and doesn't hide any data - anything can still be passed or accessed directly from or between components.

### Definitions & Guides

See [Creating Components](/classic/forge/components/creating-components) to get started! Or you can explore the following topics in detail:

* [<Icon icon="puzzle-piece" iconType="solid"/> Component](../components/): a class that implements one or more _protocols_. It can be added to an agent to provide additional functionality. See what's already provided in [Built-in Components](/classic/forge/components/built-in-components).
* [<Icon icon="gear" iconType="solid"/> Protocol](/classic/forge/components/protocols): an interface that defines a set of methods that a component must implement. Protocols are used to group related functionality.
* [<Icon icon="screwdriver-wrench" iconType="solid"/> Command](/classic/forge/components/commands): enable _agent_ to interact with user and tools.
* [<Icon icon="robot" iconType="solid"/> Agent](/classic/forge/components/agents): a class that is composed of components. It's responsible for executing pipelines and managing the components.
* **Pipeline**: a sequence of method calls on components. Pipelines are used to execute a series of actions in a specific order. As of now there's no formal class for a pipeline, it's just a sequence of method calls on components. There are two default pipelines implemented in the default agent: `propose_action` and `execute`. See [<Icon icon="robot" iconType="solid"/> Agent](/classic/forge/components/agents) to learn more.
