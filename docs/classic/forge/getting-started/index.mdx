### <Icon icon="rocket" iconType="solid" size="28"/> **Get Started!**

The best way to get started is to fork or download the AutoGPT repository and look at the example agent in `classic/forge/agent/forge_agent.py`. This can work as a starting point for your own agent. Agents are built using _components_ which provide different functionality, see the [Component Introduction](../components/introduction/). You can find built-in components in `classic/forge/components/`.
