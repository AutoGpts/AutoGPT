# AutoGPT docs

Welcome to the AutoGPT Docs.

The AutoGPT project is now split into 4 sections.

[AutoGPT Agent](/AutoGPT/setup.md): The Original Agent That Started It All

[AutoGPT-Benchmarks](/benchmarks/benchmark.md): The benchmark offers a stringent testing environment. Our framework allows for autonomous, objective performance evaluations, ensuring your agents are primed for real-world action.

[AutoGPT-Forge](/forge/get-started.md) : The forge is your innovation lab. All the boilerplate code is already handled, letting you channel all your creativity into building a revolutionary agent. It's more than a starting point, it's a launchpad for your ideas. All tutorials are located [here](https://aiedge.medium.com/autogpt-forge-e3de53cc58ec).

[Frontend](/front-end/the-ui.md): The frontend is your personal command center. It gives you a user-friendly interface to control and monitor your agents, making it easier to bring your ideas to life.
