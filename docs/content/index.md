<a href="benchmarks/benchmark.md">AutoGPT-Benchmarks</a>: Test to impress with AutoGPT Benchmarks! Our benchmarking system offers a stringent testing environment to evaluate your agents objectively. With AutoGPT, you can rest assured that your agents are primed for real-world action.

📈 Top Performance - Among our currently benchmarked agents, AutoGPT consistently scores the best. However, this dynamic landscape will change after the hackathon, where the top-performing generalist agent will earn the esteemed position as the primary AutoGPT. 🎊

🔌 Agent Protocol Standardization - To maintain a uniform standard and ensure seamless compatibility, AutoGPT employs the agent protocol from the AI Engineer Foundation. This standardizes the communication pathways from your agent to the frontend and benchmark, making integration and performance evaluation a breeze.
