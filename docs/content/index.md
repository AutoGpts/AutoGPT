The AutoGPT project is now split into 4 sections
AutoGPT: The Original Agent That Started It All

AutoGPT-Benchmarks: The benchmark offers a stringent testing environment. Our framework allows for autonomous, objective performance evaluations, ensuring your agents are primed for real-world action.

AutoGPT-Forge: (The forge)[docs/content/forge/readme.md] is your innovation lab. All the boilerplate code is already handled, letting you channel all your creativity into building a revolutionary agent. It's more than a starting point, it's a launchpad for your ideas. All tutorials are located (here)[https://aiedge.medium.com/autogpt-forge-e3de53cc58ec].

Frontend: The frontend is your personal command center. It gives you a user-friendly interface to control and monitor your agents, making it easier to bring your ideas to life.
