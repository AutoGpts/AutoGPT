# Auto-GPT: An Autonomous GPT-4 Experiment

Auto-GPT is an open-source application that explores the capabilities of the GPT-4 language model by autonomously building chains of LLM "thoughts" to achieve specific goals. It is one of the first examples of GPT-4 running autonomously, pushing the limits of AI technology.

## Features
- Autonomously create chains of LLM "thoughts"
- Explore the capabilities of the GPT-4 language model
- Push the limits of AI technology
