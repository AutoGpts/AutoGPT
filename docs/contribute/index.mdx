## Setting up the Docs

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT.git
    ```

2.  Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    python -m pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
    ```

3.  Start iterating using mkdocs' live server:

    ```bash
    mkdocs serve
    ```

4.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

5.  The server will automatically reload the docs when you save your changes.


## Adding a new page

1.  Create a new markdown file in the `docs/content` directory.
2.  Add the new page to the `nav` section in the `mkdocs.yml` file.
3.  Add the content to the new markdown file.
4.  Run `mkdocs serve` to see your changes.

## Checking links

To check for broken links in the documentation, run `mkdocs build` and look for warnings in the console output.

## Submitting a Pull Request

When you're ready to submit your changes, please create a pull request. We will review your changes and merge them if they are appropriate.
