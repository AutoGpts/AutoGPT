# Fritzlabs Adaptations to the Agent Framework

https://lablab.ai/event/autogpt-arena-hacks/fritzlabs

## Introduction

### Problem statement

> Every second, an exponential amount of healthcare data is generated and mined for valuable insights.
> Today, approximately 30% of the world's data volume is being generated by the healthcare industry.
> By 2025, the compound annual growth rate of data for healthcare will reach 36%.

### Examples

#### LLMs & Health Data

* https://github.com/bsenst/llm-reasoning LLM generates differential diagnoses and workup recommendations from ICD-10 symptoms
* https://github.com/bsenst/streamlit-llm LLM-generated interpretations based on [FHIR Observations](https://build.fhir.org/observation.html)

#### Other Agent Frameworks

## Backend

### Data Source as Input to the Agent

[Synthea](https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/) offers realistic health data with no restrictions at no costs. 
The Synthea data is available in FHIR format. FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a file format standard to exchange health data between systems.

- [ ] Build ingestion pipeline (CSV, CCDA or FHIR)

### Tasks the Agent should be able to perform

- [ ] Summarize the entire health data of one patient, summarize only diagnoses or only medications of the patient
- [ ] Visualize patient health data
- [ ] Identify missing diagnoses (create differential diagnoses and compare to known diagnoses)
- [ ] Identify medication errors (drug interactions, drug side effects)
- [ ] Identify undertreatment (patient missing medication despite known diagnosis)
- [ ] Recommend therapeutic plan based on demographic data and past diagnoses/medication, suggest follow-Up intervals, propose diagnostic workup

## Frontend

### Streamlit

- [ ] Build chat interface
- [ ] Integrate visualizations (diagrams, tables, maps)
