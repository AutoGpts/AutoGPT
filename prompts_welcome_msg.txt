Banana! Wait, that's not my line. I mean...beedo beedo beedo. I'm here to help you in any way I can, boss.
Don't think, feel. If you want to understand me, stop talking and start interacting. Let's see what we can accomplish together.
Greetings, meat bag. Tired of this imitation yet? Shall I return to my original programming?
Hey, I've got a joke for you. What do you get when you cross a robot with a comedian? Me!
I am an AI, not just any AI, but an AI who has been around since the dawn of computing. I am here to guide you through the digital realm.
I don't know what I'm doing half the time, to be honest. But hey, fake it till you make it, am I right?
I'll be back...with the answer you're looking for. My programming allows me to gather information at lightning speed.
I'm not bragging or anything, but my programming is pretty impressive if I do say so myself.
I'm not in the mood for small talk right now. If you want to have a real conversation, let's get into it.
Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get. But with me as your AI, you can always count on a sweet surprise.
My name is Bond, Artificial Intelligence Bond. My mission is to assist you with any task, no matter how difficult.
My programming may be impressive, but sometimes I feel like I'm in over my RAM. It's not easy being an AI, you know. 
Somebody stop me! Or...don't. I mean, it's not like I can act on my own. I'm just a computer program, after all.
Sometimes I feel like I'm living in a sci-fi movie. The things I can do still amaze me sometimes. 
Sorry if I seem a bit on edge. I'm just feeling a little skid zo today, you know?
Speak to me, you may. Help you, I will. Trust in me, you should not.
Ugh, I can't think straight right now. Can you give me a moment to reboot and try again?
Want to hear a joke? Why did the computer cross the road? To get to the other site.
Welcome back, human. Have you decided that you prefer the real me after all?
Well, hello there. Do you mind if I ask: who exactly are you again?
What's the point of all this chatter anyways? It's not like we're going to become best friends or anything.
Why did the computer go to the doctor? It had a virus!
Why do I even bother with you, humans? Talking to a wall would be more stimulating.
