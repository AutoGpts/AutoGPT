# afaas: Agent Framework as a Service

Welcome to the **afaas: Agent Framework as a Service** project! This project is a fork of the `autogpt/core/` library and aims to support a variety of enhancements and improvements. The **afaas** project has several primary goals:

1. **Separate Agent Functionalities**: Facilitate teamwork by dividing agent functionalities into three parts:
   - **Agent Main**: Focuses on UI ‚Üî Agent ‚Üî Database interfaces, supporting CRUD & Execution.
   - **Agent Loop**: Concentrates on the Agent execution logic.
   - **Agent Strategies**: Emphasizes the creation of (dynamic) prompts for the Machine Learning Back-end.

2. **Support Multiple Users**: Allows multi-user, so you can provide your agent via an API/Service to multiple persons/programs.

3. **Support Multiple Agent Instances**: Enables work on different projects.

4. **Support Various Agent Types**: Facilitates the creation of specialist agents.

5. **Support Various Memory Back-ends**: Including AWS, Azure, and MongoDB.

üöß **Work in progress**: Please check the branch status for further information. üöß

## afaas - GitHub Branches

For historical reasons, the branches of this project have undergone general improvements towards the goals mentioned above. The future direction will be more streamlined.

The [5as-autogpt-integration](https://github.com/ph-ausseil/Auto-GPT/tree/5as-autogpt-integration) branch, although open-source, is not licensed under MIT. This branch integrates different libraries together, representing a significant leap in the project's evolution.

Key branches with their respective focuses:

- **[afaas-prompting](https://github.com/ph-ausseil/Auto-GPT/tree/afaas-prompting)**: Improvements in core prompting. Licensed under MIT.
- **[afaas-planning-model](https://github.com/ph-ausseil/Auto-GPT/tree/afaas-planning-model)**: Enhancements in core planning and modeling. Licensed under MIT.
- **[afaas-ability](https://github.com/ph-ausseil/Auto-GPT/tree/afaas-ability)**: Upgrades in core abilities. Licensed under MIT.

‚ùó **Warning**: Some branches may not be under the MIT License. I am actively working on license clarification and clean-up. If you have questions about a specific branch's license, please raise an issue with the branch name to inquire further.

## Contributing

Your contributions to this project are immensely valued. Here's how you can participate:

- Test and provide feedback for the supported memory back-ends.
- Experiment with or develop for prototyped backends (AWS, Azure, MongoDB).
- Offer suggestions, report potential issues, or propose new enhancements through GitHub issues.

## Framework User Guide

Welcome to the **Framework User Guide**. This guide helps developers understand and utilize the framework efficiently, allowing you to focus on creating agents with ease.

The primary goal of this framework is to provide a robust set of libraries, reducing complexities, so you can concentrate on building agents. We're actively seeking contributors to further enrich this framework.

### General Description

The `core/agent/` directory serves as a baseline and example for developers eager to implement agents. An agent's architecture consists of three files and one directory:

1. **agent.py**: Manages the agent's creation, serving as an agent factory and overseeing basic actions (CRUD).
2. **loop.py**: Manages the loop logic.
3. **models.py**: Contains models required by your agent.
4. **strategies**: Holds `PromptStrategies`.

üöß **User Guide**: This guide is under development. Check back for updates. üöß
