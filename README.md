Title: **Swarms Of Sparta**

1. **API Key Security**:
   - [ ] Implement a robust method for managing user API keys securely, possibly through encryption, to ensure safe interactions with the Discord bot.

2. **Forge Integration**:
   - [ ] Integrate AutoGPT with Forge to augment functionality and user experience.
   - [ ] Integrate other popular agents such as Smol, Swarms, and Ikigai into Forge.

3. **Meta Configuration**:
   - [ ] Enhance the default configuration of our AutoGPT instance by incorporating useful plugins.
   - [ ] Refine the output and the ability to summon AutoGPT from Discord using @Leonidas, currently utilizing `gravelBridge/AutoGPT-Discord` for integration.
   - [ ] Investigate other free services and plugins to further extend AutoGPT's functionality, having explored `gravelBridge/AutoGPT-BingAI`.
   - [ ] Develop a fine-tuned version of AutoGPT with the plugins and alterations to allow users to select specific plugins to include and provide the needed API keys or work off of a provided one.

4. **Task Integration**:
   - [ ] Develop integration for group and individual tasks accessible through @Leonidas commands, enhancing the project management aspect of our app.

5. **Replication and Continuity**:
   - [ ] Introduce a feature where multiple instances of the Discord bot can be created through the @Leonidas `/summon` command.
   - [ ] Explore options for users to run this continuously on local LLMs, possibly through a plugin like [this](https://github.com/danikhan632/Auto-GPT-Text-Gen-Plugin).

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product):

Following Elon Musk's engineering philosophy, the primary objective for the MVP is to ensure a seamless integration between Discord and AutoGPT. The following tasks are crucial for achieving this:

- [ ] Ensure secure handling of API keys.
- [ ] Successful integration of AutoGPT with Forge.
- [ ] Basic task integration for group and personal task management.
- [ ] Functional summon command to spawn instances of the Discord bot.
- [ ] Official deployment of the Discord bot.
- [ ] Implement a summarization feature to handle long-running outputs and provide a way to interact with AutoGPT during runtime.


## Stretch Goals:


Stretch goals encompass additional features and integrations that enhance the functionality and user experience of the project:

- [ ] Add the ability for AutoGPT to call upon other specialist agents through the `./run agent start <agent name>` command.
- [ ] Integrate other specialist agents, for example, the Ikigai agent for goal creation.
- [ ] Research and integrate features from other inspiring Discord bots.
- [ ] Enable AutoGPT to interact with other Discord bots as tools, including invoking more instances of AutoGPT and executing other Forge agents' commands.
   - [ ] Research and identify potential Discord bots that could be utilized as tools by AutoGPT.
   - [ ] Develop a mechanism for AutoGPT to invoke commands of other Discord bots.
   - [ ] Establish a secure and efficient communication channel between AutoGPT and other bots.
   - [ ] Implement a feature to execute `./run agent start <agent name>` command through other bots.
   - [ ] Test the integration thoroughly to ensure reliability and security.
- [ ] Enable AutoGPT to join voice channels and interact with users over voice.
- [ ] Explore the integration of other popular agents into Forge such as Smol, Swarms, and Ikigai.
