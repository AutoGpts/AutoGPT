## Building blocks

### 🏗️ Forge

**Forge your own agent!** &ndash; Forge is a ready-to-go template for your agent application. All the boilerplate code is already handled, letting you channel all your creativity into the things that set *your* agent apart. All tutorials are located [here](https://medium.com/@aiedge/autogpt-forge-e3de53cc58ec).

🚀 [**Getting Started with Forge**](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/blob/master/autogpts/forge/tutorials/001_getting_started.md) &ndash;
This guide will walk you through the process of creating your own agent and using the benchmark and user interface.
