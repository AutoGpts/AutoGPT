1. Design and deploy a system that I can communicate and provide feedback to you.
2. Provide recommendations for improving our effectiveness to work as a team.
3. Generate further autonomous agents to streamline processes and accomplish all tasks that I communicate to you.
4. Design and code a working application that accomplishes all of the above, then deploy it.
5. Execute all goals in this order then terminate because the improved application has been deployed and we will continue working together on that application.
