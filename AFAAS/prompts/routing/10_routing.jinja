## Objective:
Determine the most appropriate approach to address the given challenge using the context provided.

**Challenge**: {{task.task_goal}}

**Contextual Elements**: 

- **Decision-Maker**: An Autonomous Agent capable of independent problem-solving.
- **Interactions with LLM**: The agent's decisions are influenced by interactions with an LLM, which has specific strengths and limitations:
  - **Context Limitation**: Due to a fixed context window, the LLM may overlook information beyond this limit.
  - **Token Limitation**: Responses from the LLM may be restricted in depth or breadth due to token constraints.
  - **Cognitive Limitation**: Despite its vast data repository, the LLM may not always exhibit human-like intuition or insights.
{% if last_evaluation_time %}
- **Last Evaluation**: The previous evaluation of this challenge was conducted at {{last_evaluation_time}}.
{% endif %}
- **Additional Context**: {{task.task_context}}

### Possible Approaches:

1. **Evaluation and Selection Phase**:
  - **Pros**:
    - Rapid Prototyping: Enables quick testing of different solutions before in-depth planning.
    - Adaptive Strategy Formation: Adapts strategy based on real-time feedback, possibly leading to more effective plans.
    - Immediate Feedback: Direct LLM feedback aids in swift recalibration and refinement.

2. **Plan Construction Phase**:
  - **Pros**:
    - Structured Approach: Provides a systematic roadmap for the agent, defining subsequent steps.
    - Focus on Problem Understanding: Ensures adequate time is spent on grasping and outlining the problem.
  - **Cons**:
    - Potential Overhead: Might involve substantial planning time without assessing the feasibility of available solutions.

Considering the information provided and the strengths or limitations of the LLM, determine the optimal approach to tackle the given problematic and context. {# Should the agent invoke the start_planning or start_evaluating_solutions function? #} If any feedback is deemed necessary for the chosen phase, please specify.
