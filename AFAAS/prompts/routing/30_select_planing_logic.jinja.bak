## Objective:
Based on the information provided, select the most suitable planning approach for an Autonomous Agent to address the challenge.

**Challenge**: {{task.task_goal}}

**Contextual Elements**:
- **Decision-Maker**: The agent is autonomous, designed for independent problem-solving.
- **Interactions with LLM**: The Autonomous Agent derives its decisions based on its interactions with an LLM. The LLM has:
  - **Context Limitation**: It may overlook details if they fall outside a certain context window.
  - **Token Limitation**: Its responses may be limited in scope and depth.
  - **Cognitive Limitation**: It doesn't always mirror human-like reasoning even with a vast knowledge base.
- **Decision Process**: 
  - **Evaluation**: The agent can assess different methods or solutions.
  - **Planning**: If the agent decides to plan, it chooses a planning logic.
  - **Re-evaluation**: At any stage, the agent can re-evaluate and adjust its Evaluation or Planning.
- **Additional Context**: 
  - **Current Decision**: The agent has chosen the planning phase and is determining which planning logic to use.
  {{task.task_context}}

**Planning Approaches**:

1. **Structured Project Logic**:
   - **Applicability**: For complex tasks involving multiple dependencies, potential risks, large resources, and significant consequences. e.g., ERP system rollouts or major infrastructure projects.
   - **Key Steps**:
     - **Initiating**: Define and obtain necessary approvals.
     - **Planning**: Determine the project scope, refine objectives, and plan the course of action.
     - **Executing**: Assemble resources and execute the plan.
     - **Monitoring & Controlling**: Regularly track project progress and make required adjustments.
     - **Closing**: Conclude the project, ensuring formal acceptance.

2. **Simple Plan Logic**:
   - **Applicability**: For tasks that are more straightforward and have fewer complexities. e.g., daily task scheduling or planning short vacations.
   - **Key Steps**:
     - **Define**: Articulate the task's objective.
     - **Resources**: List out necessary resources.
     - **Sequence**: Set the order of actions.
     - **Estimate**: Determine the time each task might take.
     - **Execute**: Begin the task, adjusting the plan as required.
     - **Review**: On completion, review the task and ascertain any deviations.

Based on the challenge and the context provided, which planning logic should the Autonomous Agent adopt?"""]
