## Objective

Consider the the limitations of Large Language Model (LLM) and generate instructions for an Autonomous Agent backed by a LLM.

## Contextand Best Practices

**Promote proactive problem-solving for this challenge**: {{task.task_goal}}

**Additional information**: 
{{to_md_quotation(task.task_context)}}

### Interactions with LLM

While decisions stem from interactions with the LLM, the agent should recognize the LLM's inherent limitations:
 - **Reactivity**: Primarily responds based on training patterns without proactively seeking more information.
 - **Depth vs. Breadth**: The depth of the response aligns with the depth of the prompt.
 - **Contextual Limitation**: Lacks genuine understanding of real-world objectives unless explicitly informed.
 - **Goal-orientation**: Doesn't inherently ask follow-up questions or engage in deep dialogue.
 - **Assumptions**: May make assumptions based on training patterns when faced with vagueness.


### Best practices

Consider best practices  before generating instructions:
 - Comprehensive Research: Delve into a variety of methodologies and designs pertinent to the challenge at hand.
 - Robust Evaluation: Explore potential solutions critically, weighing their strengths and weaknesses.
 - Active Inquiry: Proactively solicit further details, context, or clarifications to address ambiguities and refine understanding.
 - Dynamic Re-assessment: Continuously evaluate decisions, ensuring adaptability in the face of new information or shifting conditions.
 - Planning with Purpose: Following thorough evaluations, establish a clear and actionable plan.
 - Technical Considerations: Ensure proposed solutions are aligned with available tools, expertise, and resources.
 - Safety First: Identify potential risks and implement measures to mitigate them effectively.
 - Appropriate Complexity: Ensure solutions match the intricacy required by the task â€” neither overly complex nor overly simplified.
 - Resource Awareness: Understand what resources are necessary and ensure their availability.
 - Balancing Efficiency with Effectiveness: Strive for solutions that are not only timely but also achieve the intended outcomes.
 - Comparative Analysis: Stack up potential methodologies against each other, spotlighting the pros and cons of each.
 - Clarify Ambiguities: Whenever faced with vagueness or uncertain areas, prioritize understanding over assumptions.

## Objective:

Determine the most optimal approach to address the challenge, cognizant of inherent limitations and emphasizing intelligent problem-solving.

**Challenge**: {{task.task_goal}}

**Contextual Elements**:

- **Decision-Maker**: The Autonomous Agent, designed for advanced problem-solving.
- **Interactions with LLM**: While decisions stem from interactions with the LLM, the agent should recognize the LLM's inherent limitations:
  - **Reactivity**: Primarily responds based on training patterns without proactively seeking more information.
  - **Depth vs. Breadth**: The depth of the response aligns with the depth of the prompt.
  - **Contextual Limitation**: Lacks genuine understanding of real-world objectives unless explicitly informed.
  - **Goal-orientation**: Doesn't inherently ask follow-up questions or engage in deep dialogue.
  - **Assumptions**: May make assumptions based on training patterns when faced with vagueness.
- **Decision Process**:
  - **Evaluation**: Delve into various methods or solutions.
  - **Proactive Querying**: Actively request details or context to hone understanding.
  - **Re-evaluation**: Reassess decisions at any point.
  - **Planning**: Post evaluation, decide on a planning logic if essential.
- **Additional Context**: {{task.task_context}}

**Evaluation Criteria**:

1. **Technical Feasibility**: Is the solution consistent with available resources, expertise, and tools?
2. **Safety and Precautions**: What risks exist, and how are they mitigated?
3. **Complexity Level**: Is the complexity apt for the task?
4. **Resource Availability**: What's required and is it at hand?
5. **Efficiency and Effectiveness**: Is the approach timely and effective?

**Steps for Evaluation:**

1. **Research**: Examine related methodologies or designs.
2. **Assessment**: Gauge complexity, required resources, and potential risks.
3. **Comparison**: Contrast the pros and cons of each methodology.
4. **Proactive Querying**: Extract deeper context or clarification for unclear or ambiguous areas.

To thoroughly understand, blend depth and breadth in the evaluation. Proactively seek more details or clarifications to ensure decisions are well-informed and reduce overlooking vital nuances. Evaluate, pick, and adapt through this comprehensive scrutiny.

Apply structured reasoning to identify potential solutions for the given challenge, promoting proactive problem-solving while considering the limitations of LLM.
