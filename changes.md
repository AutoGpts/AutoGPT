[File: "thedavidyoungblood/Auto-GPT-PromtEngineer-Revisions/autogpt/json_utils/utilities.py"](https://github.com/thedavidyoungblood/Auto-GPT-PromtEngineer-Revisions/blob/ec75e2edf1aca231a3eb98e2084b91804ca2ef47/autogpt/json_utils/utilities.py)

Revisions Made:
- Added type hints to function parameters and return types for better code readability.
- Updated the docstring for the `validate_json` function to provide a clear description and parameter details.
- Adjusted the formatting and indentation for consistent code style.

Areas of Opportunities:
- Consider handling specific exceptions in the `extract_json_from_response` function instead of using a broad `BaseException` catch-all block.
- Evaluate error handling and exception raising in the `validate_json` function to provide more informative error messages and handle exceptions more gracefully.
- Explore options for improving the logging mechanism to provide more detailed information and customizable logging levels based on the configuration.
- Look into using a centralized configuration management system instead of passing the `Config` object to each utility function. This can improve code organization and reduce redundancy.
