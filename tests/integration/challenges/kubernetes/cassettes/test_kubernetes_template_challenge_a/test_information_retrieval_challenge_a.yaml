      your thought process and reasoning are sound. The ''kubectl get'' command is

      deployments. It is essential to verify that the deployment was successful and

      to expand on your plan by including additional steps to troubleshoot any issues
      that may arise during the deployment process. For example, you could include
      steps to check the logs of the pods or to scale up or down the number of replicas
      based on the workload. Additionally, it would be beneficial to consider incorporating
