      command to complete the task.\nYour decisions must always be made independently
      without seeking user assistance. Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue
      simple strategies with no legal complications.\n\nGOALS:\n\n1. Use the write_to_file

      Use the task_complete command to complete the task.\n3. Do not use any other
      commands.\n\n\nConstraints:\n1. ~4000 word limit for short term memory. Your
      short term memory is short, so immediately save important information to files.\n2.
