      <h2>Hello! I'm AI's "4D"</h2>
      <p>AI "four-dimensional" is a program used in various applications due to advances in artificial intelligence technology. AI "four-dimensional" can solve a variety of problems using technologies such as natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning. For example, you can provide answers to your questions, perform functions such as image classification, natural language generation, and text-to-voice support services.</p>

      <h2>AI "4차원" 목적</h2>
      <p>In AI, the term "four-dimensional" can refer to a number of things, including but not limited to: Time: In AI and machine learning, time is often treated in four dimensions and is used to analyze patterns and trends in time series data. Representation of knowledge: In some cases, AI researchers use the term "four-dimensional" to describe representation of knowledge, where the first three dimensions typically represent the physical properties of an object and the fourth dimension represents semantic meaning or context. Spatial Information: The fourth dimension can also be used to represent additional spatial information beyond the existing dimensions of length, width, and height, for example, capturing an object's location in 3D space over time. The use of the term "four dimensions" in AI may vary depending on the context and specific applications, and may also refer to different dimensions of different contexts.</p>
