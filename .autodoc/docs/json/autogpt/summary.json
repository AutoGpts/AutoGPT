  "summary": "The code in this file is designed to summarize a given text and answer a specific question using the GPT-3.5-turbo model from the Auto-GPT project. The main function, `summarize_text(driver, text, question)`, takes three arguments: a WebDriver instance, the input text, and a question related to the text.\n\nThe input text is first checked for its presence, and its length is printed. The text is then split into smaller chunks using the `split_text(text, max_length=8192)` function, which divides the text into paragraphs with a maximum length of 8192 characters.\n\nFor each chunk, the `summarize_text` function scrolls the WebDriver to a specific percentage of the page, prints the current chunk number, and creates a message using the `create_message(chunk, question)` function. This message contains the chunk and the question, asking the GPT-3.5-turbo model to either answer the question or summarize the text if the question cannot be answered.\n\nThe `create_chat_completion` function from the `autogpt.llm_utils` module is then used to generate a summary for each chunk. These summaries are combined, and a final message is created with the combined summary and the question. The GPT-3.5-turbo model is then used again to generate a final summary or answer the question based on the combined summary.\n\nThe `scroll_to_percentage(driver, ratio)` function is a utility function that scrolls the WebDriver to a specific percentage of the page, ensuring that the ratio is between 0 and 1.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\ndriver = ...  # WebDriver instance\ntext = \"Some long text to summarize...\"\nquestion = \"What is the main point of the text?\"\n\nsummary = summarize_text(driver, text, question)\nprint(summary)\n```\n\nThis code would output a summary of the input text or an answer to the given question based on the text.",
  "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `summarize_text` function and how does it work?\n   **Answer:** The `summarize_text` function takes a driver, text, and question as input, and returns a summary of the text or an answer to the question using the GPT-3.5-turbo model. It splits the text into chunks, processes each chunk, and combines the summaries before generating a final summary or answer.\n\n2. **Question:** How does the `split_text` function work and what is its purpose?\n   **Answer:** The `split_text` function takes a text and an optional max_length parameter, and splits the text into chunks based on the max_length. It does this by iterating through paragraphs and adding them to the current chunk until the max_length is reached, then yields the chunk and starts a new one.\n\n3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `create_message` function and how is it used in the code?\n   **Answer:** The `create_message` function takes a chunk of text and a question as input, and returns a dictionary with the role set to \"user\" and content containing the chunk and question. This message is used as input for the GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate a summary or answer based on the provided text and question."
