It splits the text into chunks of maximum length and yields each chunk. If the text is longer than the maximum length, a `ValueError` is raised.\n\n```python\ndef split_text(text: str, max_length: int = 8192) -> Generator[str, None, None]:\n```\n\nThe `summarize_text` function takes a `url`, `text`, `question`, and a `WebDriver` instance as input. It summarizes the text using the OpenAI API and returns the summary as a string.\n\n```python\ndef summarize_text(url: str, text: str, question: str, driver: WebDriver) -> str:\n```\n\nThe `scroll_to_percentage` function takes a `WebDriver` instance and a `ratio` (float between 0 and 1) as input. It scrolls the webpage to the specified percentage. A `ValueError` is raised if the ratio is not between 0 and 1.\n\n```python\ndef scroll_to_percentage(driver: WebDriver, ratio: float) -> None:\n```\n\nThe `create_message` function takes a `chunk` of text and a `question` as input. It returns a dictionary with the message to send to the chat completion.\n\n```python\ndef create_message(chunk: str, question: str) -> Dict[str, str]:\n```\n\nThese functions can be used in the larger project for processing and summarizing text, interacting with the OpenAI API, and handling web page scrolling.",

      "summary": "The `.autodoc/docs/json/autogpt/processing/__pycache__` folder contains compiled Python code for text processing functions used in the Auto-GPT project. These functions are essential for handling text data, summarizing content, interacting with web pages, and creating chat completion messages.\n\nThe `text.cpython-39.pyc` file contains four main functions:\n\n1. `split_text(text: str, max_length: int = 8192) -> Generator[str, None, None]`: This function takes a string `text` and an optional `max_length` (default 8192) as input. It splits the text into chunks of maximum length and yields each chunk. If the text is longer than the maximum length, a `ValueError` is raised. This function can be used to process large text inputs and ensure they fit within the constraints of the OpenAI API.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\nfor chunk in split_text(long_text, max_length=4096):\n    process_chunk(chunk)\n```\n\n2. `summarize_text(url: str, text: str, question: str, driver: WebDriver) -> str`: This function takes a `url`, `text`, `question`, and a `WebDriver` instance as input. It summarizes the text using the OpenAI API and returns the summary as a string. This function can be used to generate summaries of web page content or other text data.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\nsummary = summarize_text(\"https://example.com/article\", article_text, \"What is the main point of the article?\", driver)\n```\n\n3. `scroll_to_percentage(driver: WebDriver, ratio: float) -> None`: This function takes a `WebDriver` instance and a `ratio` (float between 0 and 1) as input. It scrolls the webpage to the specified percentage. A `ValueError` is raised if the ratio is not between 0 and 1. This function can be used to interact with web pages and ensure that relevant content is visible on the screen.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\nscroll_to_percentage(driver, 0.5)  # Scroll to 50% of the webpage\n```\n\n4. `create_message(chunk: str, question: str) -> Dict[str, str]`: This function takes a `chunk` of text and a `question` as input. It returns a dictionary with the message to send to the chat completion. This function can be used to format text data and questions for use with the OpenAI API.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\nmessage = create_message(text_chunk, \"What is the main idea?\")\n```\n\nThese functions work together to process and summarize text, interact with the OpenAI API, and handle web page scrolling in the larger Auto-GPT project.",
