  "summary": "The `PromptGenerator` class in this code is designed to generate custom prompt strings for the Auto-GPT project. These prompt strings are based on constraints, commands, resources, and performance evaluations. The class provides methods to add these elements and generate a formatted prompt string.\n\nThe `__init__` method initializes the object with empty lists for constraints, commands, resources, and performance evaluations. It also sets a default response format.\n\nThe `add_constraint`, `add_command`, `add_resource`, and `add_performance_evaluation` methods allow users to add elements to their respective lists. For example, to add a constraint, you would call `add_constraint(\"constraint\")`.\n\nThe `_generate_command_string` method generates a formatted string representation of a command, while the `_generate_numbered_list` method generates a numbered list from given items based on the item_type.\n\nFinally, the `generate_prompt_string` method generates the final prompt string based on the added constraints, commands, resources, and performance evaluations. It formats the response in JSON and ensures it can be parsed by Python's `json.loads`.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `PromptGenerator` class:\n\n```python\npg = PromptGenerator()\npg.add_constraint(\"constraint1\")\npg.add_command(\"label1\", \"command1\", {\"arg1\": \"value1\"})\npg.add_resource(\"resource1\")\npg.add_performance_evaluation(\"evaluation1\")\nprompt_string = pg.generate_prompt_string()\n```\n\nThis code creates a `PromptGenerator` object, adds a constraint, command, resource, and performance evaluation, and then generates a formatted prompt string.",
  "questions": "1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `PromptGenerator` class?\n   **Answer**: The `PromptGenerator` class is designed to generate custom prompt strings based on constraints, commands, resources, and performance evaluations. It provides methods to add these elements and generate a formatted prompt string.\n\n2. **Question**: How are commands added to the `PromptGenerator` and what information is required for a command?\n   **Answer**: Commands are added to the `PromptGenerator` using the `add_command` method, which requires a command label, command name, and an optional dictionary of arguments.\n\n3. **Question**: How is the final prompt string generated and what is its format?\n   **Answer**: The final prompt string is generated using the `generate_prompt_string` method, which combines the constraints, commands, resources, and performance evaluations into a formatted string, along with a JSON response format description."
