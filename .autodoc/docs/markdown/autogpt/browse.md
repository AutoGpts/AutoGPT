This code is responsible for scraping and summarizing text from webpages. It is designed to be used in the larger Auto-GPT project, which leverages OpenAI's GPT models for various tasks. The code consists of several functions that perform different tasks, such as validating and sanitizing URLs, extracting text and hyperlinks from webpages, and summarizing the extracted text using the GPT model.

The `scrape_text` function extracts the main text content from a webpage, while the `scrape_links` function extracts hyperlinks. Both functions use the `get_response` function to fetch the webpage content and handle errors. The `get_response` function also checks for local file access restrictions and validates the URL format.

The `summarize_text` function is responsible for summarizing the extracted text using the GPT model. It first splits the text into smaller chunks using the `split_text` function. Then, it iterates through the chunks, adding them to the memory and generating summaries using the `create_chat_completion` function. The summaries are combined and a final summary is generated.

Here's an example of how the code can be used:

```python
url = "https://example.com"
text = scrape_text(url)
question = "What is the main topic of the webpage?"
summary = summarize_text(url, text, question)
print(summary)
```

This example scrapes the text from the given URL, and then summarizes it using the GPT model to answer the question about the main topic of the webpage.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `scrape_text` function?
   **Answer:** The `scrape_text` function is used to scrape the text content from a given webpage URL. It first gets the response from the URL, then uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content, removes script and style tags, and extracts the text content in a clean format.

2. **Question:** How does the `summarize_text` function work?
   **Answer:** The `summarize_text` function takes a URL, text, and a question as input. It splits the text into chunks, adds the chunks to memory, and then uses the LLM model to generate summaries for each chunk. Finally, it combines the summaries and generates a final summary using the LLM model based on the given question.

3. **Question:** What is the role of the `memory` object in this code?
   **Answer:** The `memory` object is used to store information about the text and summaries generated during the scraping and summarization process. It is used to keep track of the source URL, raw content parts, and content summary parts, which can be helpful for the LLM model to generate better summaries and answers to the given questions.
