The code in this file is designed to summarize a given text and answer a specific question using the GPT-3.5-turbo model from the Auto-GPT project. The main function, `summarize_text(driver, text, question)`, takes three arguments: a WebDriver instance, the input text, and a question related to the text.

The input text is first checked for its presence, and its length is printed. The text is then split into smaller chunks using the `split_text(text, max_length=8192)` function, which divides the text into paragraphs with a maximum length of 8192 characters.

For each chunk, the `summarize_text` function scrolls the WebDriver to a specific percentage of the page, prints the current chunk number, and creates a message using the `create_message(chunk, question)` function. This message contains the chunk and the question, asking the GPT-3.5-turbo model to either answer the question or summarize the text if the question cannot be answered.

The `create_chat_completion` function from the `autogpt.llm_utils` module is then used to generate a summary for each chunk. These summaries are combined, and a final message is created with the combined summary and the question. The GPT-3.5-turbo model is then used again to generate a final summary or answer the question based on the combined summary.

The `scroll_to_percentage(driver, ratio)` function is a utility function that scrolls the WebDriver to a specific percentage of the page, ensuring that the ratio is between 0 and 1.

Example usage:

```python
driver = ...  # WebDriver instance
text = "Some long text to summarize..."
question = "What is the main point of the text?"

summary = summarize_text(driver, text, question)
print(summary)
```

This code would output a summary of the input text or an answer to the given question based on the text.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `summarize_text` function and how does it work?
   **Answer:** The `summarize_text` function takes a driver, text, and question as input, and returns a summary of the text or an answer to the question using the GPT-3.5-turbo model. It splits the text into chunks, processes each chunk, and combines the summaries before generating a final summary or answer.

2. **Question:** How does the `split_text` function work and what is its purpose?
   **Answer:** The `split_text` function takes a text and an optional max_length parameter, and splits the text into chunks based on the max_length. It does this by iterating through paragraphs and adding them to the current chunk until the max_length is reached, then yields the chunk and starts a new one.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `create_message` function and how is it used in the code?
   **Answer:** The `create_message` function takes a chunk of text and a question as input, and returns a dictionary with the role set to "user" and content containing the chunk and question. This message is used as input for the GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate a summary or answer based on the provided text and question.
