The code in this file serves as a utility module for the Auto-GPT project, providing functions to handle user input and validate YAML files. It imports the `yaml` library for parsing YAML files and the `colorama` library for colored terminal output.

The `clean_input` function is a wrapper around the built-in `input` function, which takes a prompt string as an optional argument. It captures the `KeyboardInterrupt` exception, which occurs when the user presses Ctrl+C, and gracefully exits the program with a message instead of raising an error.

```python
def clean_input(prompt: str = ""):
    ...
```

The `validate_yaml_file` function takes a file path as input and checks if the file exists and is a valid YAML file. It returns a tuple containing a boolean value and a message. The boolean value is `True` if the file is valid and `False` otherwise. The message provides information about the validation result, such as the file not being found or a YAML parsing error.

```python
def validate_yaml_file(file: str):
    ...
```

These utility functions can be used in the larger Auto-GPT project to handle user input and validate configuration files. For example, the `clean_input` function can be used to get user input for various settings, while the `validate_yaml_file` function can be used to ensure that the provided configuration files are valid before proceeding with the main tasks of the project.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `clean_input` function and how does it handle KeyboardInterrupt exceptions?
   **Answer:** The `clean_input` function is a wrapper around the built-in `input` function to handle user input. It catches KeyboardInterrupt exceptions (e.g., when the user presses Ctrl+C) and gracefully exits the program with a message.

2. **Question:** How does the `validate_yaml_file` function work and what are the possible return values?
   **Answer:** The `validate_yaml_file` function takes a file path as input, attempts to open and parse the file as a YAML file, and returns a tuple with a boolean value and a message. The boolean value is True if the file is successfully validated, and False otherwise. The message provides information about the validation result or any errors encountered.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of using `colorama` and `Fore` in the code?
   **Answer:** The `colorama` library is used to add color to the text output in the terminal. `Fore` is an enumeration of foreground colors provided by the `colorama` library, and it is used in this code to colorize the file name and error messages for better readability.
