The code in this file provides utility functions to count the number of tokens in messages and strings for different GPT models. These functions are useful for estimating token usage in the larger Auto-GPT project, which can help manage API usage and costs.

The `count_message_tokens` function takes a list of messages and a model name as input and returns the total number of tokens used by the messages. It first tries to get the appropriate encoding for the given model using the `tiktoken.encoding_for_model` function. If the model is not found, it defaults to the "cl100k_base" encoding and logs a warning. The function then calculates the number of tokens for each message based on the model and adds them to the total token count. For example, if the model is "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301", it adds 4 tokens per message and adjusts the count based on the presence of a name in the message.

The `count_string_tokens` function takes a text string and a model name as input and returns the number of tokens in the string. It gets the appropriate encoding for the given model using the `tiktoken.encoding_for_model` function and then calculates the number of tokens using the `encoding.encode` method.

Here's an example of how these functions can be used:

```python
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like today?"}
]
model_name = "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301"

message_tokens = count_message_tokens(messages, model_name)
string_tokens = count_string_tokens("What's the weather like today?", model_name)

print(f"Message tokens: {message_tokens}")
print(f"String tokens: {string_tokens}")
```

This would output the number of tokens used by the messages and the string for the specified GPT model.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `count_message_tokens` function and what are its inputs and outputs?
   **Answer**: The `count_message_tokens` function calculates the number of tokens used by a list of messages. It takes a list of messages (each message being a dictionary containing the role and content) and an optional model name as inputs, and returns the total number of tokens used by the list of messages.

2. **Question**: How does the code handle cases where the specified model is not found or not implemented?
   **Answer**: If the specified model is not found, the code logs a warning and uses the "cl100k_base" encoding as a fallback. If the model is not implemented, the code raises a `NotImplementedError` with a message indicating that the function is not implemented for the given model.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `count_string_tokens` function and what are its inputs and outputs?
   **Answer**: The `count_string_tokens` function calculates the number of tokens in a given text string. It takes a text string and a model name as inputs, and returns the number of tokens in the text string.
