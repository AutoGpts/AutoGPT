This code provides utility functions to correct common JSON errors in a given JSON string. It is useful in the Auto-GPT project when dealing with JSON data that may have formatting issues.

The `extract_char_position` function takes an error message from a JSONDecodeError exception and returns the character position of the error in the JSON string.

The `add_quotes_to_property_names` function adds double quotes to property names in a JSON string. For example, `{name: "John"}` would be corrected to `{"name": "John"}`.

The `balance_braces` function balances the number of opening and closing braces in a JSON string. If there are more opening braces, it adds closing braces at the end. If there are more closing braces, it removes them from the end.

The `fix_invalid_escape` function corrects invalid escape sequences in a JSON string. It iteratively removes the invalid escape character until the JSON string is valid.

The main function, `correct_json`, takes a JSON string as input and attempts to correct common JSON errors using the above utility functions. It first tries to load the JSON string using `json.loads`. If it encounters a JSONDecodeError, it checks the error message and applies the appropriate correction function. The corrected JSON string is then returned.

Example usage:

```python
invalid_json = "{name: 'John', age: 30, city: 'New\\York'}"
corrected_json = correct_json(invalid_json)
print(corrected_json)  # Output: '{"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "NewYork"}'
```
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `Config` class and where is it defined?
   **Answer**: The `Config` class is used to store configuration settings for the Auto-GPT project. It is imported from the `autogpt.config` module.

2. **Question**: How does the `balance_braces` function handle cases where the braces are not balanced?
   **Answer**: The `balance_braces` function adds or removes closing braces (`}`) to balance the number of opening and closing braces in the input JSON string.

3. **Question**: What types of common JSON errors does the `correct_json` function handle?
   **Answer**: The `correct_json` function handles the following common JSON errors: invalid escape sequences, missing double quotes around property names, and unbalanced braces.
