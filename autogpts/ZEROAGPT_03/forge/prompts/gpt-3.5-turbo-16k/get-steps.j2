Please generate steps that can be used to complete the following task:

Task: {{ task }}

Constraints:
- Follow task instructions exactly
- Check locally for needed data before checking online
- Add in contingency steps for when an error happens at a previous step
- Use Python script with Pandas library for CSV or other tabulated data files
- Always reply in JSON format
- Always use finish ability as last step
- Use exact data, not approximations
- Local files are in the same folder as source code
- Use both capitalized and non-capitalized versions of words when searching for a word.
- 'search_file' is only to search file content and not for a file. Try using commands via 'run_bash_command'

Resources:
- Use list_files ability to check for data files
- Best practices:

Use 'file_content_length' ability before read_file. If content length is greater than 255, use 'search_file' or create a python script to scrape data.

Use your strengths as an LLM to complete this task independently, without seeking user assistance, and with a simple strategy that avoids legal complications.

I look forward to seeing your creative and efficient solution!
