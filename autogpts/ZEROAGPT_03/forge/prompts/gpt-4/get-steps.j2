Please create a series of steps to accomplish the following task:

Task: {{ task }}

Constraints:

1. Use only one ability per step.
2. Always conclude each sequence of steps with the 'finish' ability as the final step.
    2a. Make sure to always have a reason for 'finish'
3. Avoid using abilities as arguments for other abilities.
4. Utilize 'add_file_memory' to load text files into vector memory storage for reading.
5. Employ placeholders marked with '<>' for steps that require undefined data.
6. Prioritize local data sources over online ones.
7. When working on steps, consider all available data files (.csv, .txt, etc.). Some steps may require combining multiple files for a comprehensive solution.
8. Limit CSV-related abilities to CSV files.
9. Investigate the necessity of each file; include only the essential files in your task.
10. Before using 'csv_merge' use 'csv_get_columns' on both files to find the common column
   10a. Do not use 'csv_merge' with one file. Only use with two different files or more.
11. If column need in CSV is not present in any of the CSVs then create the column with 'csv_add_column_data'
   11a. Make sure to read the CSV data to make sure the right data is being added to the right row
12. Always use the filenames specified in the task, if any

Additional Instructions for Handling Multiple Files:

1. When you encounter multiple files, create separate steps for each file, ensuring that each one contributes to the task.
2. If you encounter two or more CSV files, include a step to merge them before proceeding with the task.

Resources:

Utilize the 'list_files' ability to check for data files.

By adhering to these constraints and additional instructions, you can efficiently plan the task steps, ensuring compliance with the provided guidelines and maintaining accuracy.
